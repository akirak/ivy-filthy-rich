This package adds more information on ivy candidates.
It also allows you to customize what is the information and how are they displayed.

Inspired by [[https://github.com/Yevgnen/ivy-rich][ivy-rich]].

*Features* 

- add information to ivy buffer
- customizable position
- cuztomizable face
- more to come if I can think of any

* Showcase

* Install

The package is not in melpa, so you need to download and load it yourself.

* Useage
  
** Out of the box
   
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ivy-filthy-rich-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Simple customizations

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defcustom ifrich-padding ?\s
  "The padding of `ifrich-delimiter'.
It is used when there are extra space.
The length of the pad has to be one.
If not, `ivy-filth-rich' will fallback to using space to pad.

Currently only support character, because `make-string' only accept that."
  :type 'character
  :group 'ivy-filthy-rich)

(defcustom ifrich-pad-side 'right
  "The side which padding is pad to.
Either left or right.

Left means align right,
right means align left."
  :type 'symbol
  :group 'ivy-filthy-rich)

(defcustom ifrich-max-length 0
  "The max length of one entry (one line on ivy buffer).
If it is zero, the max-length is (1- (frame-width))"
  :type 'number
  :group 'ivy-filthy-rich)
#+END_SRC

** Deeper customization

Basically, there are three steps in a full customization.

*** 0. prepare some info functions

An info function is a function which you pass in a candidate 
and it returns some extra information about the candidate.

You can checkout default ones under
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;
;; Info Function (Return info string list, used in format)
;;
#+END_SRC

For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun ifrich--get-major-mode (candidate)
  "Return major mode of buffer (CANDIDATE)."
  (list (substring-no-properties (symbol-name (buffer-local-value 'major-mode (get-buffer candidate))))))
#+END_SRC

This function returns the major mode in which the candidate is.
Actually, it returns a list, rather than a string. The reason is explained below.


*** 1. declare the format

Now you need to declare a format for a particular ivy-function.

Default ones are under
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;
;; Default formaat
;;
#+END_SRC

For example,
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar ifrich-default-switch-buffer-format
  '(((value . (lambda (candidate) (list candidate))) (prop . 0.2) (candidate . t))
    ((value . ifrich--get-major-mode)                (prop . 0.2) (face . (:foreground "#61AFEF")))
    ((value . ifrich--get-dir)                       (prop . 0.6) (face . (:foreground "#98C379"))))
  "The default format for `ivy-switch-buffer'.
Format rule in info (C-h i).")
#+END_SRC

As you see, the format is a list of alists. Each alist is a piece of extra information (except candidate).
And the list represents a line in ivy buffer.

The order of the infos is the order of them in ivy buffer, from left to right.
Note that candidate doesn't need to be the first one.

Avaliable keys for alists are:
- value :: the function that returns a list of possible information strings.
           Those strings sorts from the longest to the shortest.
           =ivy-filth-rich= will try to use the longest string,
           if it doesn't fit, =ivy-filthy-rich= will try the next one, and so on.
           
- prop :: the length that the info can occupy. It is a fraction against =ifrich-max-length=.
          =0.3= means the piece of info will get 30% of the max length.
          All the props don't have to add up to 1, though.
          
- face :: The face you want the info be in.
          
- candidate :: A boolean that marks which info is original candidate. There can be only one candidate.
               And there is no need to add =(candidate . nil)= to other infos.
               

*** 2. deploy your format
    
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ivy-set-display-transformer 'ivy-function-you-want-to-modify (lambda (candidate) (ifrich--format-candidate candidate your-customized-format)))
#+END_SRC

Simple, =ifrich--format-candidate= takes a candidate string and a format, and returns the modified string.
